# caffeine - minimum viable backend

A very basic REST service for JSON data - enough for prototyping and MVPs!

Features:
- no need to set up a database, all data in memory
- REST paradigm CRUD for multiple entities
- sesrch using jq like syntax
- easy to deploy as container

### How to

Simply start the server with:

```go 
go run caffeine.go
```
optionally provide -ip_port param, default is `127.0.0.1:8000`

Store a new "user" with an ID and some json data:

```sh
> curl -X POST -d '{"name":"jack","age":25}'  http://localhost:8000/ns/users/1
{"name":"jack","age":25}
```

the value will be validated, but it could be anything (in JSON!)

retrieve later with:

```sh
> curl http://localhost:8000/ns/users/1
{"name":"jack","age":25}
```

### All operations

Insert/update
```sh
> curl -X POST -d '{"name":"jack","age":25}'  http://localhost:8000/ns/users/1
{"name":"jack","age":25}
```

Delete
```sh
>Â curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/ns/users/1
```

Get by ID
```sh
> curl http://localhost:8000/ns/users/1
{"name":"jack","age":25}
```

Get all values for a namespace
```sh
> curl http://localhost:8000/ns/users
[{"1":{"age":25,"name":"jack"}},{"2":{"age":30,"name":"john"}}]
```

Get all namespaces
```sh
> curl http://localhost:8000/ns
["users"]
```

Delete a namespace
```sh
> curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/ns/users
{}
```

Search by property (jq syntax)
```sh
> curl http://localhost:8000/search/users?filter="select(.name==\"jack\")" 
{"results":[{"1":{"age":25,"name":"jack"}}]}
```

### Run as container

```sh
> docker build -t caffeine .
```
and then run it:
```sh
> docker run --publish 8000:8000 caffeine
```
